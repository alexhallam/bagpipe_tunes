# Bagpipes


This is a collection of music I play or is significant to me in some way.

### How to compile

I am using `lilypond` to convert music represented as text to a pdf. I also use an extension [bagpipemusic](https://github.com/svenax/bagpipemusic.ly). See docs for bagpipe music [https://lilypond.org/doc/v2.22/Documentation/notation/bagpipes](https://lilypond.org/doc/v2.22/Documentation/notation/bagpipes).

Assuming you have `lilypond` installed do the following from the command line.

```
git clone <get this url>
cd bagpipes/airs
lilypond skye_boat_song.ly
```

Then use the browser or a program like `zathura`, any pdf viewer would work, to view the result.

this is it
